Sane layouts for the THE KEYBOARD

Kinesis Advantage2 is the state-of-the-art ergonomic keyboard with sofisticated configuration setup.

This setup here is

    * qwerty-based
    * simple
    * customized instead of being universal
    * autodocumented
    * intended to transform the potential powers of the keyboard into the kinetic ones

To install it you have to

    * update the keyboard firmware to 1.0.516 as described here: https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/advantage2/
    * get to power-user mode pressing progm+shift+esc
    * mount and open the folder with configs pressing progm+F1
    * copy the configs over the existing ones
    * press progm+F1 once again to unmount the config folder and apply the new configuration

You're more than welcome to make configs better sending me pull requests or creating issues. I'm more than free to ignore those requests.
